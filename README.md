## Prepare
1. Download the game and install it https://www.lastwar.com/Download/Setup.exe
2. Download and unpack this script https://github.com/carono/last-war-vp-bot/archive/refs/heads/master .zip

## Launch
![UOPilot](https://github.com/carono/last-war-vp-bot/blob/f20acd34993135de2ea5cdc4b19c9dcd3be0f2fd/img/uopilot.png)
1. Launch uopilot242.exe
2. Open the script in the application (Script > Open) vp_auto_approve.lua
3. Click run

If everything is in order, the script will launch the game and check the applications itself, if any.

If nothing happens or an error appears, I'm really sorry, everything is working for me :D

With respect,
Server #972 Carono
