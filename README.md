## Disclaimer
The script is based on the ancient autoclicker program for the Ultima Online game. There are probably more convenient clicker programs, but I haven't used them.

The script is provided as is, there is a 90% chance that it will not run on your PC without dancing with a tambourine, so the author of the code is not responsible for its performance.


## Prepare to start
1. Download the game and install it https://www.lastwar.com/Download/Setup.exe
2. Download and unpack this script https://github.com/carono/last-war-vp-bot/archive/refs/heads/master .zip

## Launch
![UOPilot](https://github.com/carono/last-war-vp-bot/blob/f20acd34993135de2ea5cdc4b19c9dcd3be0f2fd/img/uopilot.png)
1. Launch uopilot242.exe
2. Open the script in the application (Script > Open) vp_auto_approve.lua
3. Click run

If everything is in order, the script will launch the game and check the applications itself, if any.

If nothing happens or an error appears, I'm really sorry, everything is working for me :D

With respect,
Server #972 Carono

* If you frequently log into your account from another device, the PC game may freeze without any visible signs, as a result of which the scripts will stop working.
