# Automatic assignment to the ministry in the game Last War: Survival on PC
The script is based on the ancient autoclicker program for the Ultima Online game. There are probably more convenient clicker programs, but I haven't used them.

The script is provided as is, there is a 90% chance that it will not run on your PC without dancing with a tambourine, so the author of the code is not responsible for its performance.

# Description

The script: 
* automatically starts the game
* Appoints ministers
* removes them if they work for more than 10 minutes (temporarily unavailable)
* If you log into the game from your phone, the script will wait 15 minutes before opening it again.

## Prepare
1. Download game and install game https://www.lastwar.com/Download/Setup.exe
2. Download and unpack this script https://github.com/carono/last-war-vp-bot/archive/refs/heads/master.zip

## Run
![UOPilot](https://github.com/carono/last-war-vp-bot/blob/f20acd34993135de2ea5cdc4b19c9dcd3be0f2fd/img/uopilot.png)
1. Run uopilot242.exe
2. Open script in application (Script > Open) vp_auto_approve.lua 
3. Click run button

If everything is fine, the script will start the game, and it will check the applications itself, if any.

If nothing happens, or an error appears, I'm really sorry, everything works for me :D

Best regards, 
Server #972 Carono
