## Disclaimer of liability
The script is based on an ancient clicker program for the game Ultima Online. There may be more convenient clicker programs, but I haven't used them.

The script is provided as is, there is a 90% chance that it will not run on your PC without dancing with a tambourine, so the author of the code is not responsible for its performance.


## Get ready to launch
1. Download the game and install it https://www.lastwar.com/Download/Setup.exe
2. Download and unpack this script https://github.com/carono/last-war-vp-bot/archive/refs/heads/master.zip

## Launch
![UOPilot](https://github.com/carono/last-war-vp-bot/blob/f20acd34993135de2ea5cdc4b19c9dcd3be0f2fd/img/uopilot.png)
1. Launch uopilot242.exe
2. Open the script in the application (Script > Open)
3. Click run

If everything is in order, the script will launch the game and check the applications itself, if any.

If nothing happens or an error appears, I'm really sorry, everything is working for me :D

With respect,
Server #972 Carono

## Known issues
* If you frequently log into your account from another device, the PC game may freeze without any visible signs, as a result of which the scripts will stop working.
