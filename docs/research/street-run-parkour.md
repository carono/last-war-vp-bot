# «Уличный забег» / Street Run (Surfing endless runner)

Reconnaissance for task #1101 — a Subway-Surfers-style 3-lane endless runner event:
run as far as possible, dodge obstacles, limited attempts. Findings are **proven by
live inspection of the client** (server **935**, 2026-07-29); open items are called out.

> **Correction (2026-07-29).** Earlier sessions mapped this to *Ghost Parkour*
> (`LWGhostParkourDataManager`) — **wrong**. That manager reports `nil` even while the
> event is open. On the correct account the event is internally **Surfing**:
> `DataCenter.LWSurfingDataManager`, windows `UISurfingBattle*`, source
> `Assets/Main/LuaScripts/DataCenter/LWSurfing/LWSurfingDataManager.lua`. The two
> earlier blockers compounded: wrong account **and** wrong manager.

## TL;DR

- Display name **«Уличный забег»**; internally the **Surfing** minigame. Manager
  `DataCenter.LWSurfingDataManager` (method names say *Parkour*, e.g.
  `SendGetAllParkourInfosMessage`, `MsgDefines.ParkourFightStart` — the feature was
  renamed «surfing» in code but keeps parkour message names).
- **Event is OPEN** (live-proven). Fingerprint that pinned the manager: the panel shows
  best distance **8185** and **28** attempts → `LWSurfingDataManager` is the *only*
  manager whose `GetRemainTimes()==28` **and** `GetPersonalHightestScoreData()==8185`.
  `GetActId()==80063` = activity `id=80063, type=349` in `ActivityListDataManager`.
- Because the run is real-time, per-frame state must be read by **vision** (mss
  screenshot + image processing), not Lua — a SafeDoString round-trip is ~1 s, far too
  slow for a reflex loop. The manager holds only meta (records, attempts, timings).

## Three "parkour"-named things — do NOT confuse

| Feature | Manager / entry | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| **«Уличный забег» runner** ✅ target | `DataCenter.LWSurfingDataManager`, windows `UISurfingBattle*` | The Subway-Surfers 3-lane dodge runner (metres, obstacles, revives). |
| LW Parkour campaign | `ParkourManager`, `GoLWParkourBattle()` → `UIParkourMap` | A **squad auto-battle** stage campaign. NOT the target. |
| Ghost Parkour co-op | `LWGhostParkourDataManager`, `UIGhostParkour*` | Weekly co-op «Операция Призрак» / ghost-recon. Reports `nil` here. NOT the target. |

## `DataCenter.LWSurfingDataManager` API (dumped live, 92 methods)

State / meta (live values in parens):

- `GetActId` (=80063 — the activityId) · `SetActId`
- `GetRemainTimes` (=28 — «Попыток испытания») · `GetRound` (=4)
- `GetPersonalHightestScoreData` (=8185 — best distance, metres, a plain number)
- `GetTodayPersonalProgressScore` (=3282) · `GetTheBattleEndTime`
  (=1785722400000 ms; `endTime−now ≈ 5.006 d`, matches on-screen «5d»)
- `GetResurgenceLimit` (=3) · `GetResurgenceCost` (revive price, x100 coins)
- `GetCoinId`/`GetCoinNum` (parkour coins) · `GetParkourRankInfo`, `GetSurfingRankInfo`,
  `GetMvpPlayer`, `GetAllianceScore`, `GetSurfingBuffData`, buff/battlepass getters

Run control (send server requests — do NOT call idly, each `ReqFightStartCheck`
**consumes an attempt**):

- **`ReqFightStartCheck(restart)`** — the in-game «Начать» button. `string.dump`:
  checks `ActWinterStormManager:CheckInMatchingViewState`, the start-msg cooldown
  (`GetStartMsgCD`/`startMsgTs`; on cooldown → `UIUtil:ShowTipsId(avatar_tips002)`),
  then `SFSNetwork:SendMessage(MsgDefines.ParkourFightStartCheck, restart, curTs)`.
  Server-approved flow → `OnStartGame` → the runner scene loads. **Proven live:**
  `ReqFightStartCheck(false)` started a real run (attempts 28→27).
- `ReqStartGame(restart)` — raw `SFSNetwork:SendMessage(MsgDefines.ParkourFightStart,…)`,
  skips the checks. `restart=false` = fresh run.
- `ReqRebirthGame` / `ReqRebirthInfo` — revive on the death popup (3 available, x100 coins).
- `ReqEndGame`, `ReqEndStage`, `ReqMonsterCheck`, `ReqTimeCheck`, `FightStartCheck`.
- **`GoBackToActivityPanel()`** — dismisses the «Испытание окончено» result popup and
  returns to the event panel. **Proven live** — required between runs (the popup blocks
  a fresh `ReqFightStartCheck`).

Network fetch (populate the manager): **`SendGetAllParkourInfosMessage`**,
`SendGetParkourAllianceBattlePassInfoMessage`. Rank refresh:
`UpdateSurfingBattleRankInfo`, `UpdateAllianceBattleList`.

## Confirmed mechanics (live frames — `results/street_run/frames/live_*.png`)

- **3-lane endless runner**, third-person behind-the-back. The avatar auto-runs
  forward and starts in the **centre** lane (screen x ≈ 0.49·W, y ≈ 0.63·H).
- **Obstacles**: cars, container trucks, side barriers/blocks, streetlamps — occupy
  specific lanes; dodge by switching lanes (jump/slide likely exist — unconfirmed).
- **Coins** float along a lane (collectible; top-right counter).
- **Score = distance in metres** (top-left «NNм» + running icon). Best so far 8185.
- **Uncontrolled the run dies at ~88 m** (first obstacle) in <3 s — deterministic;
  useful as a control-signal baseline.
- **Death popup** «Испытание окончено»: result metres, parkour coins earned, buttons
  **«Выйти»** and **«Воскрешение ×100»**, «Оставшиеся воскрешения: 3/3». Dismiss via
  `GoBackToActivityPanel()` (or click «Выйти»). A **«Пауза»** button sits bottom-left
  during the run.

## Vision reflex loop — approach & open items

1. **Capture** the road ROI with `mss` in a tight **in-memory** loop (no per-frame PNG
   save — the calibration capture ran ~4 fps only because it wrote a PNG each frame;
   in-memory grab+detect should hit <30 ms, fast enough).
2. **Detect** the avatar's current lane and the nearest obstacle's lane from a fixed
   band ahead of the avatar. Lane x-boundaries to calibrate from `live_*.png`.
3. **React** with `pydirectinput` (foreground input; PostMessage ignored — see memory
   `project_input_model`). **Input model UNCONFIRMED** — Left/Right = change lane and
   Up/Down = jump/slide is the genre default, but the exact keys must be tested live
   (or read off the user playing).

## Input model (confirmed by the user)

Keyboard arrows via `pydirectinput` (foreground): **← / →** switch lane, **↑** jump,
**↓** slide. v1 of the bot uses lane-switch only.

## Auto-play — how `detect()`/`decide()` work (v2, 2026-07-29)

- **Player lane**: blue-helmet centroid in the bottom-centre ROI → x-threshold to
  lane 0/1/2. Avatar sits at x≈0.49 (centre) by default. Reliable.
- **Obstacles** — the cartoon palette defeats a fixed threshold *and* even per-pixel
  labelling (gold coins are pixel-identical to a **lit barrel**: both H≈18 S≈170 V≈220;
  a white crosswalk ≈ a pale concrete barrier). v2 leans on two robust ideas instead:
  1. **Blob geometry.** Build an obstacle mask (robust road reference = median over a
     wide low road band, so the coin trail sitting on the centre patch no longer
     poisons it; a pixel is an obstacle if it is off-brown-hued = truck, brighter+
     desaturated = concrete, much more saturated = barrel/orange barrier, or much
     darker = shadow/underside). Then connected-component filter: keep large solid
     blobs, drop thin-wide markings (crosswalk/dashes), thin diagonals (lamp poles),
     and **narrow gold blobs (coins) by WIDTH** (<0.055·W) — do NOT colour-carve gold,
     that deletes lit barrels and kills the run.
  2. **Differential decide().** The game always leaves a passable lane, so a real
     obstacle shows up as ONE lane much more blocked than a neighbour; a row blocked
     ~equally across all three is a ground marking → hold. `decide()` runs to the
     **least-blocked reachable lane** (argmin) when it beats the current lane by a
     margin; jump (↑) only when walled in with no clearer neighbour.
- **Loop**: in-memory grab+detect at **~12–15 fps**. A 0.18 s cooldown after each key
  stops lane-change overshoot. Death = the big near-white «Испытание окончено» card.
- **Revive**: on death, up to 3× **click the «Воскрешение» button** (screen-relative
  (0.565·W, 0.59·H)) to continue the SAME run — distance carries over. The Lua
  `m:ReqRebirthGame()` does **not** revive (verified: the popup still reports 3/3
  after it). Revives are coin-priced and the price ramps (×100 → ×1000 → ×2000…), so
  ~3 per run is the practical limit. `remainTimes` spends 1 per whole multi-life run.
- **pid auto-resolve**: `find_win()` re-resolves the LastWar.exe pid via
  `il2cpp_probe.find_game_pid()` every call — the client self-restarts into new pids,
  so a hardcoded one silently breaks window capture.
- **Offline tuning**: `test [pattern]` runs `detect()`/`decide()` on saved
  `results/street_run/frames/*.png` and writes annotated copies — tune the detector
  without spending an attempt. `run … debug` logs per-frame perception.

## Status vs. the task

- ✅ **Manager identified & proven** — `LWSurfingDataManager`; probe reports OPEN.
- ✅ **Launch/loop/revive proven live** — `ReqFightStartCheck(false)` starts a run;
  the «Воскрешение» button-click continues it; `GoBackToActivityPanel()` clears the
  popup between runs; `run` chains attempts, revives, logs, screenshots, keeps a reserve.
- 🟡 **Auto-dodge works but has an inherent ceiling.** Live (server 935, 2026-07-29):
  per-life the reflex dodges **~100–160 m**; a run with 2–3 revives reaches **~440 m per
  attempt, deterministically** (not the luck-dependent 439 of v1's best single life),
  vs the **~88 m** no-control baseline. **The 20000 m target — and even the 8185 m human
  record — is not reachable by this pipeline.** At ~15 fps the loop cannot thread the
  fast obstacle spawns reliably, and the coin/barrel colour collision caps segmentation
  quality. Raising the ceiling needs a materially faster capture (cropped grab / GPU) and
  cleaner obstacle segmentation (edge/depth cues), not more tuning of this loop.

`tools/street_run_bot.py`: `probe` (state), `shot`, `test` (offline detector on frames),
`watch` (durable poll + sentinel), `calibrate` (start a run + grab frames), `record`
(capture-only for user play), `run [reserve] [revives] [debug]` (the reflex loop; keeps
`reserve` attempts default 5, spends `revives` 0..3 per run default 0, `debug`=1 logs frames).
